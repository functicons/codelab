This example demonstrates how to shade guava:11.0 introduced by hadooop-yarn-client:2.9.0.

yarn-app
  -> guava:20.0
  -> hadoop-yarn-client:2.9.0
       -> guava:11.0

Project hadoop-yarn-client-shaded is a wrapper for hadoop-yarn-client, which creates a uber jar
hadoop-yarn-client-shaded-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar with com.google.com (of Guava 11.0) shaded as
repackaged.com.google.com.

Project yarn-app is an example YARN application which depends on
hadoop-yarn-client-shaded:1.0-SNAPSHOT and Guava 20.0.

Run the example with:

$ mvn clean package install
$ mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose -Dincludes=com.google.guava
